# Week 4: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

Welcome to Week 4 of AI Coding Essentials! This week, you'll learn to build Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that enable AI models to access and reason over external knowledge sources, dramatically expanding their capabilities beyond their training data.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- Understand the fundamentals of RAG architecture and when to use it
- Build document processing pipelines for various file formats
- Implement vector databases for semantic search and retrieval
- Create RAG systems that combine retrieval with generation for accurate, contextual responses
- Design and optimize embedding strategies for different use cases

## Week 4 Exercises

### Core Exercises
1. [Exobrain Challenge](https://github.com/ai-powerup-oct-25/aice-exobrain) - Build a personal knowledge management system using RAG to query your own documents and notes

### Alternative Challenge
1. [Vercel AI RAG Chatbot Tutorial](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/guides/rag-chatbot) - Follow Vercel's comprehensive RAG chatbot tutorial (TypeScript only, uses OpenAI API for embeddings)

### Optional Exercises
1. [Anonymizer Exploration](https://github.com/ai-powerup-oct-25/aice-anonymiser) - Explore this data anonymization tool to understand how RAG systems can work with sensitive information while maintaining privacy
2. [Continue Your Personal Project](./exercises/plan-your-personal-project.md) - Apply RAG concepts to enhance your ongoing project with external knowledge capabilities
3. **Connect Exobrain to the AICE Chatbot** - Integrate your exobrain RAG system with the chatbot from earlier weeks to create a personalized knowledge-enhanced assistant

## Weekly Tasks

- [ ] Watch the weekly video:

### Optional
- [ ] Explore the Anonymizer tool to see RAG with privacy considerations
- [ ] Connect your exobrain to the AICE chatbot
- [ ] Share your RAG implementation in the [#show-and-tell Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/690141234596937780/1427499665812881518)
- [ ] Experiment with different chunking strategies for your documents
- [ ] Try different embedding models and compare their performance

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Vector Embeddings**: Converting text into numerical representations for semantic similarity
- **Semantic Search**: Finding relevant information based on meaning rather than exact keywords
- **Chunking Strategies**: Breaking down large documents into manageable pieces for retrieval
- **Retrieval Optimization**: Techniques for improving the quality and relevance of retrieved information
- **RAG Evaluation**: Methods for measuring the effectiveness of retrieval and generation components
