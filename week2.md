# Week 2: Building with LLMs

Welcome to Week 2 of AI Coding Essentials! This week, you'll learn about building applications with Large Language Models (LLMs) using frameworks like LangChain and creating user interfaces with Streamlit.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- Understand the core concepts of LangChain and abstraction libraries
- Build simple LLM-powered applications
- Create interactive web interfaces with Streamlit
- Apply prompt engineering techniques in real applications
- Connect multiple components to create end-to-end AI solutions

## Week 2 Exercises

### Core Exercises
1. [Build a LangChain Chatbot](https://github.com/ai-powerup-oct-25/aice-chatbot) - Create a functional AI chatbot with streaming responses and optional web browsing capabilities
2. [Plan Your Personal Project](./exercises/plan-your-personal-project.md) - Design a project that you'll work on throughout the remainder of the course

### Optional Exercise
3. [LangChain Joke Teller](./exercises/langchain-joke-teller.md) - Build a simple joke generator using LangChain
