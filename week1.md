**[Watch: Introduction to Agentic Coding Assistants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8F-_CQEeLw)**

## Overview

This week you'll explore **agentic coding assistants** - AI tools that can autonomously plan, execute, and iterate on coding tasks with appropriate supervision.

**What you'll learn:**
- How agentic coding differs from other AI assistance (in editor assistants, chatbots, CI)
- Which agentic coding tools are available and how to choose one
- How to personalize your agentic coding workflow to match your style
- Common workflow frameworks that help you work more effectively with AI assistants

**Why this matters:**
Agentic coding assistants represent a fundamental shift in how we write code. Instead of suggesting the next line, they can understand your goals, break down complex tasks, and execute multi-step solutions - becoming true coding partners rather than just autocomplete tools.

## Activities for the Week

### Try One or More Agentic Coding Assistants

1. **[Gemini CLI](https://geminicli.com/)** (best free option)
   - Free tier: 60 requests/minute
   - Installation: `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli`

2. **[Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview)** or **[Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/)** (if you have a paid subscription to either Anthropic or OpenAI)
   - Claude Code: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
   - Codex CLI: See OpenAI documentation for setup

3. **[OpenCode.ai](https://opencode.ai)** (if you want to try many different providers)
   - `npm install -g opencode-ai`

### Research AI Workflows

1. **Promptkit** - [GitHub](https://github.com/ai-powerup-oct-25/promptkit) | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5-2cLSFMDc)
2. **Snarktank's AI dev tasks** - [GitHub](https://github.com/snarktank/ai-dev-tasks) (there is a video linked in the github repo, it a little interesting)
3. **JV's _ai.dev** - [GitHub](https://github.com/joshuavial/_ai.dev)

### Create Your Personalized AI Workflow

Create a GitHub repository with the workflow files you want to use when coding agentically.

Include whatever files work for you - prompts, templates, checklists, or workflow definitions inspired by Promptkit, ai-dev-tasks, or \_ai.dev.

Share it with the group in discord, along with any reflections you have on agentic coding.
