# Week 3: Evaluation, Workflow & Observability

Welcome to Week 3 of AI Coding Essentials! This week, you'll learn to build robust AI applications with proper evaluation frameworks, efficient workflows, and comprehensive observability that enable continuous improvement.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- Install and configure local AI models using Ollama and LM Studio
- Create custom tools for AI agents using LangChain's `@tool` decorator
- Design structured output schemas using Pydantic models for reliable data extraction
- Implement comprehensive observability using Langfuse for monitoring AI applications
- Set up tracing and analytics to track conversation flows and performance metrics

## Week 3 Exercises

### Core Exercises
1. [Structured Output Challenge](https://github.com/ai-powerup-oct-25/aice-extractor) - Build a smart data extractor using Pydantic and LangChain structured output
2. [Tool Use Challenge](https://github.com/ai-powerup-oct-25/aice-calculator) - Build an AI agent that uses tools to solve math problems step by step
3. [Add Observability](./exercises/setup-langfuse-observability.md) - Add Langfuse tracing to either your calculator agent or job extractor to monitor performance and analyze behavior

### Optional Exercises
1. [Continue Your Personal Project](./exercises/plan-your-personal-project.md) - Apply evaluation and observability concepts to your ongoing project
2. **Review Chatbot Development Stages** - Explore the evolution of the AICE chatbot:
   - [Stage 2: Local Models](https://github.com/ai-powerup-oct-25/aice-chatbot/tree/main/2-local-model) - Review local model integration patterns
   - [Stage 3: Testing](https://github.com/ai-powerup-oct-25/aice-chatbot/tree/main/3-testing) - Examine testing strategies for AI applications
   - [Stage 4: Langfuse](https://github.com/ai-powerup-oct-25/aice-chatbot/tree/main/4-langfuse) - Setup Langfuse and analyze existing traces to understand observability patterns
