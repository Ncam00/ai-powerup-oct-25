# Personal Project Plan: AI Learning Companion

## Project Name
**PythonMentor AI** - Intelligent Python Programming Tutor

## Brief Description
**PythonMentor AI** is an intelligent Python programming tutor that provides personalized, interactive learning experiences. It acts as a patient coding mentor that can explain Python concepts, debug code, provide coding challenges, give hints, and adapt to the student's programming level. The system focuses on teaching Python through conversation, examples, and guided practice.

## Learning Objectives
- **LangChain Advanced Patterns**: Learn to build more sophisticated conversation flows with memory and context management
- **Prompt Engineering**: Master creating effective educational prompts that guide learning rather than just providing answers
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Integrate external knowledge sources to provide accurate, up-to-date information
- **Streamlit Advanced Features**: Build interactive UI components like quizzes, progress tracking, and visual learning aids
- **Educational AI Principles**: Learn how to design AI that teaches effectively (Socratic method, scaffolding, etc.)

## Project Scope

### üéØ **Core Features (Must Have)**
- **Interactive Python Chat**: Conversational interface for coding questions and explanations
- **Code Explanation**: AI breaks down Python code line-by-line with clear explanations
- **Debugging Assistant**: Help students find and fix errors in their Python code
- **Coding Challenge Generator**: Create practice problems at appropriate difficulty levels
- **Concept Teaching**: Explain Python concepts with examples and analogies
- **Learning Progress**: Track which Python topics have been mastered

### üöÄ **Enhanced Features (Nice to Have)**
- **Code Execution**: Run Python code snippets and show results
- **Code Review**: Analyze student code and suggest improvements
- **Project Ideas**: Suggest Python projects based on skill level
- **Library Introductions**: Teach popular Python libraries with examples
- **Code Style Guide**: Help students write clean, Pythonic code
- **Interactive Coding Exercises**: Step-by-step guided coding challenges

### ‚ùå **Out of Scope (To Keep Project Manageable)**
- Complex user authentication system
- Multi-student classroom features
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Mobile app development
- Integration with external learning management systems

## Technologies

### **Core Stack**
- **LangChain** - For LLM orchestration and conversation management
- **Streamlit** - For web interface and interactive components
- **OpenAI GPT-4** - Primary LLM for tutoring interactions
- **Python** - Main programming language

### **Additional Tools**
- **ChromaDB or FAISS** - Vector database for knowledge retrieval (if implementing RAG)
- **LangSmith** - For monitoring and debugging LangChain applications
- **Streamlit Components** - For interactive widgets and visualizations
- **Git** - Version control
- **python-dotenv** - Environment variable management

## Timeline
