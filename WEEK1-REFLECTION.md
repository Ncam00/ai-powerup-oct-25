# Week 1 Reflection: Agentic Coding Assistants

## 🎯 What I Accomplished

I successfully completed Week 1 of the AI Powerup course by:

✅ **Tried Multiple Agentic Coding Assistants**
- Installed and configured Gemini CLI
- Explored OpenCode.ai as an alternative
- Gained hands-on experience with agentic vs. traditional AI assistance

✅ **Researched Three AI Workflow Frameworks**
- **Promptkit**: Loved the focus on reflection and learning-centered approach
- **ai-dev-tasks**: Appreciated the structured PRD → Tasks → Implementation methodology  
- **_ai.dev**: Impressed by the specialized workflows for different development phases

✅ **Created My Personal AI Workflow System**

## 🚀 My Personalized Workflow

I combined the best aspects of all three frameworks into a comprehensive system:

### 🏗️ **4 Core Workflows:**
- **Project Workflow** - For building features from PRD to implementation
- **Debug Workflow** - Systematic bug investigation and resolution
- **Learning Workflow** - AI-tutored exploration and skill building
- **Reflection Workflow** - Capturing insights and planning growth

### 📋 **Supporting Materials:**
- Professional templates for PRDs and task breakdowns
- Clear setup instructions for AI assistants
- Workflow activation prompts for easy context-setting
- Learning journal for tracking progress

## 🤔 Key Insights About Agentic Coding

**What surprised me most:** How much the workflow structure matters! Having clear phases and checkpoints makes AI collaboration so much more effective than just "asking for help."

**Biggest learning:** Agentic coding isn't about the AI doing everything - it's about creating a partnership where both human and AI play to their strengths.

**Most valuable framework insight:** The reflection component from Promptkit. Regular capture of learnings transforms coding sessions into deliberate skill development.

## 🔮 Looking Ahead

I'm excited to apply this workflow system in Week 2 as we explore abstraction libraries and APIs. Having a structured approach to AI collaboration should make the learning process much more effective.

The system I built is designed to evolve - I expect to refine these workflows as I gain more experience with different agentic coding scenarios.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Primary Tool**: Gemini CLI (free tier)
- **Backup Options**: OpenCode.ai, ready for Claude Code or Codex
- **Repository**: Fully version-controlled with Git
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive setup and usage guides

Ready for Week 2! 🎉
