# Plan Your Personal Project

Throughout this course, you'll have the opportunity to work on a personal project that applies the AI concepts you're learning. This project can be as simple or as complex as you like, and you can dedicate as much or as little time to it as you choose.

You can also do multiple small projects if you wish.

## Why Create a Personal Project?

- **Apply Learning**: Put the concepts and tools from the course into practice
- **Portfolio Development**: Create something you can showcase to employers or clients
- **Personalized Learning**: Focus on aspects of AI that interest you most
- **Problem Solving**: Address a real need or challenge you've encountered

## Project Requirements

Your project should:
1. Incorporate at least one LLM or AI component
2. Be something you're genuinely interested in building
3. Be scoped appropriately for the time you have available
