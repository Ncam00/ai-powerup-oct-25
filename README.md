# AI Powerup Overview

Welcome to the AI Powerup course! This repository contains weekly materials for learning how to effectively use AI coding assistants.

## Weekly Content

### Week 0: Practice Your Python

This course uses a lot of Python, so it's good to brush up on the basics before starting. Work through the [Python Todo exercises](https://github.com/ai-powerup-oct-25/python-todo) to build or refresh your Python skills.

### [Week 1: Agentic Coding Assistants](week1.md)

Explore agentic coding assistants - AI tools that can autonomously plan, execute, and iterate on coding tasks. You'll try different tools (Gemini CLI, Claude Code, Codex CLI, OpenCode), research workflow frameworks (Promptkit, ai-dev-tasks, _ai.dev), and create your own personalized AI workflow repository.

### Week 2: Abstraction Libraries and APIs

Learn to implement AI capabilities through simplified frameworks. Explore key abstraction libraries that make LLM integration straightforward, build applications that leverage AI capabilities without deep ML expertise, and create reusable components for common AI implementation patterns.

### Week 3: Evaluation, Workflow & Observability

Establish robust practices for AI application development. Implement proper testing and evaluation frameworks for AI components, set up monitoring systems to track AI system performance, and create workflows for continuous improvement of AI-powered features.

### Week 4: Retrieval Augmented Generation

Enhance AI systems with domain-specific knowledge. Build vector databases to store and retrieve relevant information, implement semantic search, and create context-aware applications that combine your data with AI capabilities.

### Week 5: Multimodal AI

Create rich experiences combining multiple media types. Integrate text, image, audio, and other media in AI applications, build voice-powered agents, create image generation pipelines, and combine multiple AI capabilities into cohesive experiences.

### Week 6: Agent-Based AI Systems

Design and deploy autonomous AI solutions. Create AI agents that can plan and execute multi-step processes, implement tool-using capabilities, develop oversight mechanisms and guardrails, and build systems where multiple AI components work together to solve complex problems.
