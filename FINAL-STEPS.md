# Final Steps to Complete Week 1

## 🎯 You're Almost Done! 

You've completed **95%** of Week 1 requirements. Here are the final steps:

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
✅ **GitHub page is open** - https://github.com/new

**Repository Settings:**
- Name: `my-ai-workflow` (or your preference)
- Description: "Personal AI workflow system for agentic coding assistants"  
- Visibility: **Public** (so you can share with the group)
- **Don't** initialize with README/gitignore (we have files already)

### 2. Push Your Code
After creating the repository, run these commands:

```bash
cd /root/overview/my-ai-workflow

# Add GitHub as remote (replace [your-username] with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/[your-username]/my-ai-workflow.git

# Push your code
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Share in Discord
✅ **Reflection is ready** - See `WEEK1-REFLECTION.md`

**Copy this for Discord:**
```
🎉 Week 1 Complete! 

Created my personalized AI workflow system combining the best of Promptkit, ai-dev-tasks, and _ai.dev.

Key insight: Structured workflows make AI collaboration 10x more effective than ad-hoc requests!

Repository: [paste your GitHub URL here]

Ready for Week 2! 🚀
