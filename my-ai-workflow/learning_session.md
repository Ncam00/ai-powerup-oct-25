I want to activate the Learning Workflow.

I want to learn about: How to add more advanced features to my PythonMentor AI project, specifically:
1. How to add code execution capability so students can run Python code directly
2. How to implement better error handling and educational feedback  
3. How to add visual learning aids and interactive components

Let's start with Phase 1: Goal Setting. Help me define clear learning objectives and scope for enhancing my Python tutor project.
