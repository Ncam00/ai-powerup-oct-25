# My Personal AI Workflow

This repository contains my personalized workflow for working with agentic coding assistants, inspired by Promptkit, ai-dev-tasks, and _ai.dev frameworks.

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository into your project:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/my-ai-workflow
   echo 'my-ai-workflow' >> .gitignore
   ```

2. Install your preferred agentic coding assistant:
   - Gemini CLI: `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli`
   - OpenCode.ai: `npm install -g opencode-ai`
   - Claude Code or Codex CLI (if you have subscriptions)

3. Tell your AI assistant: "Read my-ai-workflow/setup.md to understand my preferred workflow"

## Workflow Options

### üéØ **Project Workflow** (`workflows/project.md`)
For building new features or projects from scratch using structured PRD ‚Üí Tasks ‚Üí Implementation approach.

### üîç **Debug Workflow** (`workflows/debug.md`)  
For investigating and fixing bugs systematically.

### üìö **Learning Workflow** (`workflows/learn.md`)

## Repository Structure

- `workflows/` - Core workflow definitions
- `templates/` - Reusable templates for common tasks
- `prompts/` - Specific prompts for different scenarios
- `notes/` - Personal learning notes and reflections
- `setup.md` - Instructions for AI assistants

## Philosophy

This workflow emphasizes:
- **Structured thinking** - Breaking down complex problems into manageable steps
- **Iterative development** - Small, verifiable changes with frequent checkpoints
- **Learning focus** - Every coding session should teach you something new
- **Flexibility** - Adapt the workflow to your specific needs and preferences
