# Learning Workflow

Use this workflow when exploring new concepts, technologies, or understanding unfamiliar code.

## Phase 1: Goal Setting üéØ

### 1. Define Learning Objectives
- What specifically do you want to understand?
- Why is this important for your current project?
- How will you know when you've learned enough?
- What's your current knowledge level on this topic?

### 2. Set Scope and Time
- How deep do you need to go?
- What's your time budget for this learning session?
- What are the must-know vs. nice-to-know elements?

## Phase 2: Exploration üó∫Ô∏è

### 3. Start with Overview
- [ ] Get high-level understanding of the concept/technology
- [ ] Understand the problem it solves
- [ ] Learn the key terminology
- [ ] Identify main components or patterns

### 4. Hands-on Learning
- [ ] Find or create simple examples
- [ ] Modify examples to test understanding
- [ ] Break things intentionally to see what happens
- [ ] Build something small from scratch

### 5. Deep Dive (if needed)
- [ ] Read documentation for specific features you're using
- [ ] Understand underlying principles or algorithms
- [ ] Explore advanced patterns or best practices
- [ ] Learn about common pitfalls and how to avoid them

## Phase 3: Application üõ†Ô∏è

### 6. Connect to Your Context
- [ ] How does this apply to your current project?
- [ ] What patterns can you adopt immediately?
- [ ] What would you do differently next time?
- [ ] What prerequisites were missing from your learning?

### 7. Practice Integration
- [ ] Try applying what you learned to a real problem
- [ ] Refactor existing code using new knowledge
- [ ] Explain the concept to someone else (or write it down)

## Phase 4: Consolidation üìö

### 8. Document Your Learning
- [ ] Write summary in `notes/learning-journal.md`
- [ ] Save useful code examples
- [ ] Bookmark important resources
- [ ] Note questions that arose for future exploration

### 9. Plan Next Steps
- [ ] What's the next logical thing to learn?
- [ ] Any immediate applications in your work?
- [ ] When should you revisit this topic for deeper learning?

## AI Assistant Guidelines for Learning

**As a Tutor, Please:**
- Ask Socratic questions to guide discovery
- Provide examples that build on each other
- Explain the "why" behind concepts, not just the "how"
- Encourage experimentation and mistakes
- Connect new concepts to things I already know
- Check understanding with "Does that make sense?" regularly
- Suggest exercises or challenges to reinforce learning

**Avoid:**
- Overwhelming with too much information at once
- Giving answers without helping me think through problems
- Using jargon without explaining it
- Moving too fast past fundamental concepts

## Learning Session Types

**Concept Learning:** Understanding new ideas, patterns, principles
**Tool Exploration:** Learning new libraries, frameworks, or tools
**Code Reading:** Understanding existing codebases or algorithms
**Skill Building:** Practicing specific programming techniques
**Problem Solving:** Working through challenging technical problems

## When to Use This Workflow

‚úÖ Learning new technologies or concepts
‚úÖ Understanding unfamiliar codebases
‚úÖ Preparing for technical challenges
‚úÖ Exploring potential solutions to problems
‚úÖ Building foundational knowledge

‚ùå Fixing specific bugs (use Debug Workflow)
‚ùå Building features with known approaches (use Project Workflow)
