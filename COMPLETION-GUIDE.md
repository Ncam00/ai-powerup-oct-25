# Week 1 Completion Guide

## ‚úÖ What You've Accomplished

### 1. Installed Agentic Coding Assistants
- ‚úÖ **Gemini CLI** - Installed successfully  
- ‚úÖ **OpenCode.ai** - Installed successfully

### 2. Researched AI Workflows
- ‚úÖ **Promptkit** - Reviewed framework focused on reflection and learning
- ‚úÖ **AI dev tasks** - Explored structured PRD ‚Üí Tasks ‚Üí Implementation approach  
- ‚úÖ **_ai.dev** - Studied provider-agnostic workflow system with specialized workflows

### 3. Created Your Personalized AI Workflow Repository
- ‚úÖ **Complete workflow system** with 4 core workflows:
  - Project Workflow (for building features from scratch)
  - Debug Workflow (for systematic bug fixing)
  - Learning Workflow (for exploring and understanding)  
  - Reflection Workflow (for capturing insights and planning)
- ‚úÖ **Templates** for PRDs and task breakdowns
- ‚úÖ **Prompts** for activating workflows and setting context
- ‚úÖ **Setup instructions** for AI assistants
- ‚úÖ **Learning journal** for tracking progress

## üî≤ Next Steps to Complete Week 1

### 1. Set Up Authentication for Agentic Tools

**For Gemini CLI:**
```bash
# Get a free API key from Google AI Studio: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
# Then add it to your environment:
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Or create a settings file:
mkdir -p ~/.gemini
echo '{"auth": {"apiKey": "your-api-key-here"}}' > ~/.gemini/settings.json
```

**For OpenCode.ai:**
```bash
# Run the auth command to set up credentials:
opencode auth
```

### 2. Test Your Workflow

Once you have authentication set up, test your workflow:

```bash
cd my-ai-workflow
gemini "Please read setup.md and tell me what you understand about working with this human developer"
```

### 3. Create GitHub Repository

```bash
# Initialize git repository
cd my-ai-workflow
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Personal AI workflow system"

# Create repository on GitHub and push
# (Follow GitHub's instructions to create a new repository)
git remote add origin https://github.com/[your-username]/my-ai-workflow.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Share with Group

Post in Discord with:
- Link to your GitHub repository
- Brief reflection on what you learned about agentic coding
- Which workflow framework inspired you most and why

## üéØ Your Unique Contributions

Your personalized workflow combines the best aspects of all three frameworks:

- **From Promptkit:** Learning focus and reflection practices
- **From ai-dev-tasks:** Structured PRD ‚Üí Tasks ‚Üí Implementation approach  
- **From _ai.dev:** Multiple specialized workflows for different contexts

**Key innovations in your workflow:**
- Clear workflow activation prompts
- Comprehensive setup instructions for AI assistants
- Balance between structure and flexibility
- Strong emphasis on learning and continuous improvement

## üìù Reflection Questions for Discord Post

Consider sharing thoughts on:
- How do you think agentic coding will change your development process?
- Which of the three research frameworks (Promptkit, ai-dev-tasks, _ai.dev) resonated most with you?
- What surprised you most about working with agentic coding assistants?
- How does your personalized workflow reflect your coding style and preferences?

## üöÄ Ready for Week 2

Once you complete these steps, you'll be fully prepared for Week 2: Abstraction Libraries and APIs, where you'll learn to implement AI capabilities through simplified frameworks.

Great work on Week 1! üéâ
