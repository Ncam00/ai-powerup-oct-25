# Activities

This folder contains exercises, prompts, and workflow extensions provided by your instructors. Treat everything in here as read-only—never modify these files in your fork. Instead:

1. Add the Dev Academy upstream remote if you have not already (your instructor will share the URL):
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream <upstream-repo-url>
   ```
2. Fetch the latest activities when your teachers announce new material:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/main
   ```
3. Capture your responses, notes, or solutions in the `notes/` folder or in separate project repositories.

If you notice a typo or issue inside `activities/`, leave a comment in the course discussion channels instead of editing the files directly. Your AI assistants should follow the same rule—keep this folder untouched.
