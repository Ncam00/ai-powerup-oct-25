# Notes Workspace

Use this folder to capture your learning goals, questions, reflections, and improvement ideas. Keep it personalâ€”your instructors review these files to understand your progress and offer targeted support.

Recommended habits:

- At the start of each week, run a short Tutor session to refresh `learning-plan.md` with goals, focus areas, and open questions.
- During `workflow tutor`, write new questions and insights directly into `learning-plan.md` so your plan stays current.
- After every study block, use `workflow reflect` to log a row in `progress-journal.md`, summarising what you asked the AI, what you learned, and what comes next.
- Capture PromptKit improvement ideas in `notes/promptkit-improvements.md` (create it the first time you identify an improvement).
- Link out to repos or exercises you worked on so you can revisit them later.

You can add additional files or subfolders here (e.g., project-specific notes). Just keep `activities/` untouched and reference any activity you complete inside your notes.
